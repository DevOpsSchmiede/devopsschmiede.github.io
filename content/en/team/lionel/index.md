Hey, I'm Lionel. In my free time, I'm learning about hosting and all things IT. This pursuit started with running a web server on a Raspberry Pi and hasnt finished yet. After school I made this hobby my profession and am working now as a Systems Engineer. This blog will be used to document my learning progress and to give others free access to IT knowledge.
