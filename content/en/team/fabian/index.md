My name is Fabian and with about 11 years old I wanted to know how websites work. In the beginning it was some kind of trial and error and learning but in the end it became my profession. Today I'm a Systems Engineer with a strong focus on DevOps. I'm also a trainer for a couple of Computer Science Apprenticeship trainees (a concept in Germany, Austria and Switzerland). More than 20 years have passed and I have seen and learned a lot of different things. However, I'm not getting tired to learn more, no matter if it's Dev or Ops, everything is interesting to me and I like to write about it.
